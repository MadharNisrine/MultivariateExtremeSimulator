# MultivaritaExtreme Simulator
This github repository provides code and some results of the paper "Assessing Extreme Risk using Stochastic Simulation" by Nisrine Madhar, Juliette Legrand and Maud Thomas.

# Overview

The code folder contain five notebooks:
- "Preprocessing_JointSimulation_Illustration" describes the data preprocessing phases completed ahead of employing joint/conditional simulation algorithms.
- "JointSimulation_ParametricExample" demonstrates the joint simulation algorithms using a parametric case study.
- "ConditionalSimulation_ParametricExample" shows the application of conditional simulation algorithms in a parametric example.
- "TRMEstimation_JointSimulation" provides an example of tail risk metrics estimation through the use of a joint simulation algorithm on synthetic data.
- "RealData_JointConditionalAlgorithm" exhibits the practical application of the joint simulation algorithm in estimating tail risk metrics and the conditional simulation algorithm in estimating conditional tail expectations on real data.

along with "Utils_StochasticSimulation.py" which contains some useful functions.

The data necessary for executing certain notebooks is stored within the data folder.
